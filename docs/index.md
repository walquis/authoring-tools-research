# Overview: Tools for authoring and publishing repo-based content

The search for fast, efficient ways to create and manage content.

## Criteria:
- Understands Markdown
- Local authoring story (including local tool install)
- Ease of publish, i.e., without programming/configuring a full CICD pipeline
- Not a subscription-based, hosted service (e.g., not [GitBook](https://gitbook.com){:target="_blank"})

## Players thus far
- [Github Pages](tools/github-pages)
- [MDBook](tools/mdbook)
- [Google Codelabs](tools/codelabs)

## See also (further research TBD):
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) - A universal document converter - Example usage [here](https://github.com/walquis/authoring-tools/pandoc-example)
- [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org/) - Used by Stark & Wayne in their [Concourse tutorial](https://concoursetutorial.com/)- "a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation."
